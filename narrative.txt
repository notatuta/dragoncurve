Many people are familiar with the regular dragon curve. You start with a single line segment, then at each step make a copy of the curve, rotate it by 90 degrees, append it to the existing curve, and repeat. The result is this beautiful fractal pattern.

But it turns out you can do this with different angles. For example, turning by 120 degrees creates this stretched pattern.
